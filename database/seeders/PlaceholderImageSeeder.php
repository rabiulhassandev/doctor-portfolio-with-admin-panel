/**
 * Copies the demo photography onto the `public` disk.
 *
 * The files live in database/seeders/media and are committed to the repository,
 * so seeding never touches the network and a buyer with no internet still gets
 * a finished-looking site.
 *
 * They are photographs rather than generated artwork because a clinic site with
 * abstract shapes where the pictures should be does not look finished — it looks
 * unfinished in a way no amount of layout can fix. They are also JPEGs rather
 * than SVGs, which matters more than it looks: the admin panel's upload field
 * previews an image by drawing it into a canvas and hangs the crop editor off
 * that preview, and neither works for a vector file.
 *
 * >>> These are stock photographs licensed for reuse, not pictures of the
 * >>> practice. Replace every one of them from the admin panel before launch.
 *
 * Delete storage/app/public/{doctor,gallery,blog,site} to clear them.
