/**
 * The upload field used for every picture on the website.
 *
 * All five image fields in the panel — the doctor's portrait, blog covers,
 * gallery photos and testimonial headshots — want the same behaviour, so it is
 * configured once here instead of five times:
 *
 *     PhotoUpload::make('cover_image')
 *         ->label('Cover image')
 *         ->directory('blog')
 *         ->guidance('Wide images work best.')
 *
 * The accepted file list is the part that matters. Filament's `->image()`
 * allows anything matching `image/*`, and that includes SVG — the one image
 * format the panel cannot actually work with. The field builds its thumbnail by
 * drawing the file into a canvas and hangs the crop/rotate editor off that
 * thumbnail, so a vector file leaves the doctor looking at a blank grey panel
 * with no preview and no way to edit the picture. Naming the three formats a
 * camera or a phone actually produces avoids that, and anyone who tries an SVG
 * is told so at upload time instead of discovering it later.
